# House Price Prediction

This project uses a Linear Regression model to predict the price of a house based on:

- 📏 Square footage (area of the house)  
- 🛏️ Number of bedrooms  
- 🛁 Number of bathrooms  

The goal is to find a relationship between these features and the house price using past data.

## Description

This is a basic machine learning project that uses Python to train a model on housing data. It helps estimate house prices by learning from existing records. The model is built using libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
